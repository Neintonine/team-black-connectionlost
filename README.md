## Contributing
We, as a team, decided to do one final build and that's it.

If you wish to fix a bug, feel free to create a fork and pull request. We will check it, and if it manages trough, we make a new build.

You obviously can create new fork and continue development, where we left off. We would love a notification of that, and obviously a mention in the credits.
